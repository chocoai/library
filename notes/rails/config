1. config/application.rb
(1) require 'rails/all': Running Code Before Rails
(2) other configurations: config/environments/*

2. configure rails components using config delegate method

3. environment settings
ENV["RAILS_ENV"]: test, development, production
ENV["RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT"]
ENV["RAILS_CACHE_ID"] and ENV["RAILS_APP_VERSION"]

4. Initializer Files - after loading the framework and any gems in the application
config/initializers

5. Initialization events
(1) before_configuration: This is run as soon as the application constant inherits from Rails::Application. The config calls are evaluated before this happens.
(2) before_initialize: This is run directly before the initialization process of the application occurs with the :bootstrap_hook initializer near the beginning of the Rails initialization process.
(3) to_prepare: Run after the initializers are run for all Railties (including the application itself), but before eager loading and the middleware stack is built.
More importantly, will run upon every request in development, but only once (during boot-up) in production and test.
(4) before_eager_load: This is run directly before eager loading occurs, which is the default behavior for the production environment and not for the development environment.
(5) after_initialize: Run directly after the initialization of the application, after the application initializers in config/initializers are run.

6. custom settings
